The neighborhood is home to many galleries and museums. Wealthy colonial buildings dot its dormant streets. It looks like there will be an art festival in this backdrop. Since 1999, the Kala Ghoda festival has been welcoming visitors from all over the world. For the intellectual type, the David Sassoon Library beckons.\n" +

            "The streets outside are filled with the depiction of art. Music bursts out of the amphitheater like the pulse of amphetamines. Food and craft booths are under siege by brilliant people. Movies are screened, plays are staged, some created especially for the occasion. As blog-affiliates blog: \"Families wander ... Curiosity written all over their faces. Corporate types come out to 'catch the festivities,' ties loosened around necks .... Tourists bustle about, eyes wide open. Teenagers flicker, their natural energy this time shared by everyone in the crowd ... \"." +
            "For a few days, this charming tree-lined site with historical monuments is transformed into a cultural theme park. Street graffiti. Airbrushed bicycles. Electric cars dressed up the city. Cala Goda skyline photos. Murals. These are just a few of the creations displayed on the streets and in galleries. But viewing the work of others isn't the only way to actively become arthritic here. Printmaking and painting workshops are offered to provide this space. But I refuse to study, for immortalization, on the sketch pad of an artist who sits under a tree that waves a happy finger at the sky. The David Sassoon Library is the place for most literary subjects." +
            "Under low lights, surrounded by trees, aspiring writers rub shoulders with established journalists. I'm drawn to discussions about the subtlety of screen writing. But what really moves my pen, my heart, my soul, is the story unfolding under my nose. Two kittens were playfully squabbling under a sign that read, \"Little Pencils,\" an upcoming writing workshop for children. People who came to participate in the live Poetry Slam competition are excited to see the contest about to begin. Other contests include Flash Essay, SMS Poetry, and Flash Fiction. Live music and dance performances are held in the amphitheater at dusk. Jazz follows the blues follows the rock. Just as Bollywood beats follow the fifth night in Lavani, a popular Maharashtrian folk dance. Pretty music against the night sky usually makes for a good time.\n";
