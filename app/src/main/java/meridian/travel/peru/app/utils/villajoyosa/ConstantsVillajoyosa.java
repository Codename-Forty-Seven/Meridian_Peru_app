The festivals last several days and are festive parades in flashy costumes inspired by medieval fashions. Christians wear furs, metal helmets and armor, shoot loudly with arquebuses and ride horses.

The festival develops amidst gunpowder shots, medieval music and fireworks and ends with the victory of the Christians in a simulated battle around the castle." +
